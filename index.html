        <h2>
          ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VERSUS COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
        </h2>

        <p>
          Although artificial intelligence is currently seen as the grand goal of technology, collective intelligence is more relevant in this age of so-called "alternative facts."
          Digital computers don't think.
          They merely execute instructions written by programmers.
          The programmers generally draw the content of these instructions from one or more experts in the particular subjects involved, which could be anything from online dating to national security.
          However, and in general, this means the result can only be as good as the limitations of the input.
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast to this, collective intelligence seeks first to optimize the input to decisions and judgments – not just by getting it from more experts, but by drawing and refining ideas from everyone participating.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan here is to provide a technology that uses collective intelligence to optimize the quality of dialogue, together with a process by which the various parties to the dialogue can reach an optimum consensus.
          The key to this technology is that it uses an information systems engineering approach to develop what we can call a dialogue convergence engine.
        </p>

        <p>
          That brings us to the first principle of engineering - "Don't reinvent the wheel."
          If a useful asset is already available, consider it.
          Indeed, although dialogue has been broadly failing, some existing technologies - facilitation technologies in particular - are providing impressive results, so we should try those out in the design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although dialogue has been failing broadly, some existing technologies are providing impressive results in promoting consensus.
          Some of these are old but updated, while some are new.
          Each has a different range of applications.
          WSP uses an information systems engineering approach to integrate these technologies - and others.

          Think of what a simple and fragile craft the Wright brothers' first flyer was, then consider that jets could fly faster than sound in Orville Wright's lifetime.
          This is the continuous evolution that engineering brings.
          Simple beginnings can lead to remarkable results over time – <strong>but there must be a working start</strong>.
          The intention here is to provide a working start on an industrial scale and strength dialogue engine that can be brought to bear on any issue, including the most urgent problems facing us.
        </p>

        <p>
          At a time when the credibility of all sources of information is in question, this technology could produce an <strong>optimally credible consensus</strong> on critical issues in a process that is fully transparent, fully inclusive, and open-ended.

          If the following seems complicated, think of a typical automobile.
          When you drive a car, a lot of parts and sub-assemblies have to work together to get you someplace.
          The technology presented here also has a number of moving parts – and they all have a purpose.
          Fortunately, there are nowhere near as many moving parts to this as to an automobile.

              Conventional (but updated) Facilitation
            </h2>

            <p>
              A revolution over the past few decades has demonstrated conclusively that people have more potential for constructive dialogue by far than is generally realized.
              This revolution has been led by professional facilitators, including Dr. Sam Kaner, whose <i>Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making</i> presents a wealth of methods to help groups navigate a decision process more effectively.
              Although the idea of facilitation itself has a long history, these modern pioneers have expanded and refined facilitation technology.
              The results have been quite impressive.
              According to Kaner –
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              Most individuals working in groups do not know how to solve tough problems on their own.
              They do not know how to build a shared framework of understanding – they seldom even recognize its significance.
              They dread conflict and discomfort and they try hard to avoid it.
              Yet, by avoiding the struggle to integrate one another’s perspectives, the members of such groups greatly diminish their own potential to be effective.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Conventional facilitation typically involves people with shared goals who need to determine how best to optimize decisions <em>in a specific context through face-to-face meetings</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most intriguing concept in the world of facilitation might be "the Diamond of Participatory Decision Making," which was developed by Dr. Kaner and his colleagues.
              It concerns the stages of the process.
              This graphic shows the sequence:
            </p>

            <img src="images/Facilitation.png" width="400px" />

            <p>
              It begins with "business as usual" but an issue arises.
              The first stage is about identifying options – this is the "divergent zone."
              Once the options are identified, it's time to start eliminating the less promising ones – this is the "groan zone," since it can be contentions and frustrating.
              It's a point at which many groups give up in exasperation.
              It's also where a shared framework of understanding is needed to enter the "convergent zone" and reach consensus and closure.
              That's an important point for later.

            </h2>

            <p>
              Face-to-face meetings aren't always an option, because it can be impractical to gather all the participants at one physical location.
              And even if people can get together, that might not always be the best option.
              Fortunately, there are some good online group dialogue products available.
              An example is "<a href="https://www.loomio.org/" target="_blank">Loomio</a>", which can work either with or without a facilitator.
            </p>

            <p>
              Loomio has been called "The Facebook of the citizen web."
              The Loomio project originated in New Zealand as a way for people in different locations to engage in participatory decision making.
              There is a strong and clear consensus among its users that it enables them to have <em>shorter meetings yet make better decisions on the issues addressed</em>.
              The Loomio site provides a range of resources, including case histories.
              Among a long list of features, Loomio supports a variety of decision styles.
            </p>

            <p>
              Other products in the online group dialogue market have various strengths and weaknesses, but many have merit in a wide range of cases.

              Dialogue Mapping
            </h2>

            <p>
              Dialogue mapping technology was initially created to help groups of people combine their insights to find useable solutions to what are called "wicked problems."
              Wicked problems are difficult because of complexity, fragmented information, changing needs, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dialogue mapping uses a step-by-step method that generates a visual display of the structure of a dialogue.
              This "shared display" makes it easier to achieve a shared understanding of how the various points are related to each other.
              According to dialogue mapping pioneer Dr. Jeffrey Conklin –
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              Shared understanding is a powerful, almost magical phenomenon of socially shared cognition.
              It transcends individual achievement, technology, personalities, and politics – it is made of the same stuff as a choir singing divinely or a basketball team in perfect synch....
              Ultimately, shared understanding is essential to achieving a workable way forward.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              This technology has an elegant simplicity to it that is reflected in its elements, which are primarily questions, ideas, pro and con factors, and decisions.
              Tracking and visually displaying the structure of a discussion can make a critical difference in disputes that might otherwise run on endlessly.

            </h2>

            <p>
              Work these days is more and more team-based, but identifying the ingredients most likely to bring about successful teams was much harder than identifying the ingredients for individual success.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2012, Google began "Project Aristotle" to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some worked poorly together while others "soared."
              Their goal was to build the most perfect teams possible.
              It became clear very early in their inquiry that the obvious approaches didn't work.
              For example, you couldn't get great teams by just combining the brightest people.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns – or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              They came to focus on "group norms," which are the informal rules of a group.
              Interestingly –
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the "good" teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.
              The right norms, in other words, could raise a group's collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Not all the good teams handled this the same way, but the researchers noticed that <em>each member spoke about the same amount as any other in the good teams</em>.
              What's more, people in the good teams were <em>better at sensing how others in the group felt, based on nonverbal cues</em>.
              These are golden keys to team construction that can make a critical difference in achieving productive dialogue.

            <p>
              Suppose you ask two people why World War I started.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first person says, "Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo."
            </p>

            <p>
              This response can be seen as technically correct, since that assassination was the proximate cause of responses that led to the war.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second person begins, "To understand why WWI started, you first have to consider the history and alliances of the European powers leading up to it."
            </p>

            <p>
              This response exhibits a deeper comprehension of why the war started and it can also help to explain how the assassination could lead so directly to the war.
            </p>

            <p>
              These forms of reasoning go back to the ancient Greeks.
              Consider that the "philosopher kings" in Plato's <i>Republic</i> were system administrators and process thinkers.
              Such reasoning embodies a much richer view of the workings of the world than common thought.
              Any serious attempt to characterize a complex, dynamic landscape, such as a national economy or an entire culture, will soon find itself drawing on the language and perspective of systems and processes.

              Conceptual Defragmentation
            </h2>

            <p>
              Facilitation theorists and practitioners routinely emphasize that building "a shared framework of understanding" is essential to progress in dialogue.
              The shared understanding of which they speak can sometimes benefit from an ancient, yet ever new, source – philosophy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some disagreements, including some of the most intractable ones, originate at a deeper level than the level at which the disputes proceed.
              This is where conceptual defragmentation can be decisive.
              The framework recommended here for this purpose can simplify the isolation, clarification, and resolution of disagreements at their source, making progress more likely.
              In the engineering spirit, the currently recommended defragmentation guide is merely "version 1.0" of a technology that could evolve indefinitely, even if the initial version of the guide is completely replaced.
            </p>

            <p>
              Conceptual defragmentation can also provide assistance on how to <em>sequence</em> topics for consideration, as we'll see below.
