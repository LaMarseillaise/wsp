          ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VERSUS COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
        </h2>

        <p>
          Although artificial intelligence is currently seen as the grand goal of technology, collective intelligence is more relevant in this age of so-called "alternative facts."
          Digital computers don't think.
          They merely execute instructions written by programmers.
          The programmers generally draw the content of these instructions from one or more experts in the particular subjects involved, which could be anything from online dating to national security.
          However, and in general, this means the result can only be as good as the limitations of the input.
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast to this, collective intelligence seeks first to optimize the input to decisions and judgments – not just by getting it from more experts, but by drawing and refining ideas from everyone participating.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan here is to provide a technology that uses collective intelligence to optimize the quality of dialogue, together with a process by which the various parties to the dialogue can reach an optimum consensus.
          The key to this technology is that it uses an information systems engineering approach to develop what we can call a dialogue convergence engine.
        </p>

        <p>
          That brings us to the first principle of engineering - "Don't reinvent the wheel."
          If a useful asset is already available, consider it.
          Indeed, although dialogue has been broadly failing, some existing technologies - facilitation technologies in particular - are providing impressive results, so we should try those out in the design.
        </p>

          THE FACILITATION TECHNOLOGIES
        </h2>

        <p>
          Although dialogue has been failing broadly, some existing technologies are providing impressive results in promoting consensus.
          Some of these are old but updated, while some are new. Each has a different range of applications.
          WSP uses an information systems engineering approach to integrate these technologies - and others.

          Think of what a simple and fragile craft the Wright brothers' first flyer was, then consider that jets could fly faster than sound in Orville Wright's lifetime.
          This is the continuous evolution that engineering brings.
          Simple beginnings can lead to remarkable results over time – <strong>but there must be a working start</strong>.
          The intention here is to provide a working start on an industrial scale and strength dialogue engine that can be brought to bear on any issue, including the most urgent problems facing us.
        </p>

        <p>
          At a time when the credibility of all sources of information is in question, this technology could produce an <strong>optimally credible consensus</strong> on critical issues in a process that is fully transparent, fully inclusive, and open-ended.

          THE BASIC WORKINGS OF THE DIALOGUE CONVERGENCE ENGINE
        </h2>

        <p>
          If the following seems complicated, think of a typical automobile.
          When you drive a car, a lot of parts and sub-assemblies have to work together to get you someplace.
          The technology presented here also has a number of moving parts – and they all have a purpose.
          Fortunately, there are nowhere near as many moving parts to this as to an automobile.
        </p>

        <p>
          The facilitation dynamics concern only the assistance provided by facilitators, whereas the overall dynamics include the interactions of all the elements of the process.
