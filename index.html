          What is the greatest problem our society faces?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Dialogue should be the wellspring of consensus and action in society, but we see it failing repeatedly at every level from daily life to international relations. Disagreements routinely degenerate into verbal pushing and shoving that exasperates those engaged while resolving nothing. Democracy itself is now being threatened by this dysfunction.

          The urgency of moving beyond this destructive dysfunction cannot be overstated.  What is presented here is a proposed path forward.

          Technologies
        </h2>

        <p>
          Although dialogue has been broadly failing, some existing technologies are providing impressive results.
          Some of these are old but updated, while some are new.
          Each has a different range of applications.
          WSP uses an information systems engineering approach to integrate these technologies into what we can call a dialogue convergence engine.

            <p>
              Conventional facilitation typically involves people with shared goals who need to determine how best to optimize decisions in a specific context through face-to-face meetings.

              Face-to-face meetings aren't always an option.
              There are some good online group dialogue products available, such as <a href="https://loomio.org">Loomio</a>.

              Dialogue Mapping
            </h3>

            <p>
              Dialogue mapping uses a step-by-step method that generates a visual display of the structure of a dialogue.
              This "shared display" makes it easier to achieve a shared understanding of how the various points are related to each other.

              You cannot get great teams by just combining the brightest people -
              a successful team must have group norms that allow each member to contribute.

              Any serious attempt to characterize a complex, dynamic landscape, such as a national economy or an entire culture, will soon find itself drawing on the language and perspective of systems and processes.

              Some disagreements, including some of the most intractable ones, originate at a deeper level than the level at which the disputes proceed.
              Building "a shared framework of understanding" is essential to progress in dialogue.
